Solved : Interface incompatibility and don't want to change interface.

Database and Records have interface incompatibility.

In this task, we used Object adapter.
Object adapter has : Client, Target, Adapter, Adaptee

Client is TestDatabase ; only sees target interface.
Target is DatabaseTarget ; each adapter implements target interface.
Adapter adapt Records and Database to match with the DatabaseTarget.
    - All adapter requests get delegated to the adaptee.
Adaptee is Records and Database.
