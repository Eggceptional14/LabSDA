Principle of Least Knowledge :  Talk only to your immediate friends.

Before :
Client(MakeTea) has to deals with the complex subsystem(tea making process).

public class MakeTea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TeaCup blueCup = new TeaCup();
        Water water = new Water();
        TeaInfuser infuser = new TeaInfuser();
        Tea tea = new Tea("Earl Grey");
        infuser.addTea(tea);
        water.boilWater();
        blueCup.addWater(water);
        blueCup.setSteepTime(15);
        blueCup.steep();

    }
}

After :
Move the complex subsystem to Facade class.
Client(MakeTea) deals talk to only Facade class(unified interface) which contains complex subsystem.
TeaFacadee defines a higher level interface -> make subsystem easier to use.

public class MakeTea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TeaCup blueCup = new TeaCup();
        Water water = new Water();
        TeaInfuser infuser = new TeaInfuser();

        TeaFacade teaMaker = new TeaFacade(blueCup, water, infuser);
        teaMaker.makeTea("Earl Grey");
    }
}

### Benefit ###
If we need to make tea multiple time, we have to call the whole sequence multiple times.

Not Using Facade:
public static void main(String[] args) {
        TeaCup blueCup = new TeaCup();
        Water water = new Water();
        TeaInfuser infuser = new TeaInfuser();
        Tea tea = new Tea("Earl Grey");
        TeaCup blueCup2 = new TeaCup();
        Water water2 = new Water();
        TeaInfuser infuser2 = new TeaInfuser();
        Tea tea2 = new Tea("Earl Grey");

        infuser.addTea(tea);
        water.boilWater();
        blueCup.addWater(water);
        blueCup.setSteepTime(15);
        blueCup.steep();
        
        infuser2.addTea(tea2);
        water2.boilWater();
        blueCup2.addWater(water2);
        blueCup2.setSteepTime(15);
        blueCup2.steep();

    }

Using Facade:

public class MakeTea {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TeaCup blueCup = new TeaCup();
        Water water = new Water();
        TeaInfuser infuser = new TeaInfuser();
        TeaCup blueCup2 = new TeaCup();
        Water water2 = new Water();
        TeaInfuser infuser2 = new TeaInfuser();

        TeaFacade teaMaker = new TeaFacade(blueCup, water, infuser);
        teaMaker.makeTea("Earl Grey");

        TeaFacade teaMaker2 = new TeaFacade(blueCup2, water2, infuser2);
        teaMaker2.makeTea("Earl Grey");
    }
}
