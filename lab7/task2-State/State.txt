State Pattern : allows an objecet to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.

State interface defines that each state has to implement their own function over 5 same buttons.

Each state has different action on the buttons.

RemoteDevice is Context class.
    - contains object of each state and variable to storee the current state of the device.
public class RemoteDevice {
	// the different states the device may be in
	private State playing;
	private State paused;
	private State stopped;
	private State rewind;
	private State locked;
	
	//the current state of the player
	private State currentState;

    // press the Play button	
	public void pressPlay() {
		currentState.pressPlay();
	}
    ##### action of Play button depends on current state of the device ####
